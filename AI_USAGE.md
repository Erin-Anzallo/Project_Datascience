# AI Usage Documentation

## Tools Used
*   **Generative AI Assistant** (Gemini)

## Purpose and Scope of Usage

I used Artificial Intelligence tools in this project to assist with several key aspects of development, analysis and documentation. The primary goal was to accelerate coding tasks, debug errors and refine the theoretical methodology.

### 1. Code Development and Debugging
*   **Dashboard Interactivity:** I used AI to help draft the complex callback logic for the Plotly Dash application, specifically getting the map and side panel to talk to each other (e.g., implementing the "Close" feature via the dropdown menu).
*   **Forecasting Pipeline:** AI helped structure the `forecast_to_2030.py` script, particularly the recursive loop for year-by-year predictions and the implementation of lagged variables.
*   **Error Resolution:** AI was used to troubleshoot specific Python errors, such as library import issues with Dash and syntax errors in data processing.

### 2. Refining the Methodology
*   **Model Selection:** I consulted AI to check my approach, specifically the decision to use **Lagged Variables** for socio-economic indicators and **Time-Series Trends** for environmental indicators.
*   **Visualization Logic:** The color-coded system (Green/Orange/Red) logic was clarified and implemented with AI assistance to ensure it correctly handles cases where targets are missed but trends are improving (comparing 2030 forecasts to the 2022 baseline).

### 3. Documentation & Reporting
*   **README.md:** AI assisted in drafting and formatting the project documentation to ensure clarity and completeness.
*   **Report Writing:** I used AI to help format this documentation and ensure the technical explanations in the final report (such as the linear regression model details) were clear and accessible.
*   **English Language Support:** AI helped me phrase my ideas clearly and professionally in English, ensuring professional clarity.

## Conclusion
While AI provided significant assistance in coding and structuring the project but I personally reviewed, tested and validated all code, data interpretations and methodological decisions.
